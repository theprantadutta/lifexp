# LifeXP - Gamified Life Management Application

## Overview

LifeXP is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter that gamifies personal productivity and life management. The application allows users to track tasks, earn experience points (XP), level up, unlock achievements, and explore a virtual world as they complete real-world activities.

The app combines elements of gamification with practical task and habit tracking to make personal development more engaging and rewarding. Users can categorize tasks, maintain streaks, visualize their progress through charts, and customize their experience with themes and avatars.

## Architecture

LifeXP follows a clean architecture pattern with a clear separation of concerns:

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **State Management**: BLoC (Business Logic Component) Pattern
- **Database**: Drift (SQLite) for local storage
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **Animations**: Rive, Lottie, Flutter Animate
- **UI Components**: Material Design with custom gamification themes

### Key Design Patterns
1. **BLoC Pattern**: For state management across features
2. **Repository Pattern**: To abstract data sources (local and remote)
3. **Dependency Injection**: Through constructor injection in repositories and BLoCs
4. **Offline-First**: Local database with synchronization to cloud services
5. **Service-Oriented**: Modular services for specific functionalities (notifications, animations, etc.)

Key properties:
- `id`: Unique task identifier
- `title`: Task title
- `description`: Task description
- `type`: Task type (daily, weekly, longTerm)
- `category`: Task category (health, finance, work, etc.)
- `xpReward`: XP reward for completion
- `difficulty`: Difficulty level (1-10)
- `isCompleted`: Completion status
- `streakCount`: Consecutive completion count
- `dueDate`: Task deadline

### ProgressEntry
Tracks daily progress and analytics for user activities.

Key properties:
- `id`: Unique entry identifier
- `userId`: Associated user
- `date`: Date of entry
- `xpGained`: XP earned on this date
- `tasksCompleted`: Number of tasks completed
- `categoryBreakdown`: XP distribution by category
- `taskTypeBreakdown`: Task distribution by type
- `streakCount`: Streak count on this date

### Avatar
Represents the user's customizable avatar with attributes.

Key properties:
- `id`: Unique avatar identifier
- `userId`: Associated user
- `level`: Avatar level
- `currentXP`: Current XP in level
- `strength`: Strength attribute
